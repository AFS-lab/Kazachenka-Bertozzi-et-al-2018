#Identification characterization & heritability of metastable epialleles: implications for
non-genetic inheritance

#strategy_explanation.pdf - Schematic representation of the genome-wide screening strategy used to identify VMIAPs.
Methylation values of eight distal CpGs from 5’ and 3’ IAP ends were extracted from WGBS
and WGoxBS datasets. The average methylation of eight distal CpGs in each biological replicate
was quantified and the average methylation levels from all replicates were sorted from highest to
lowest. The second highest and second lowest values were used to quantify variation between
biological replicates. Analysis of methylation variation was done separately for 5’ and 3’ ends.
